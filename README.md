Coin Combainer

We have to wright a func gets a number with an amount of cents. The func must return the array where:

coins[0] = pennies ==> $00.01

coins[1] = nickels ==> $00.05

coins[2] = dimes ==> $00.10

coins[3] = quarters ==> $00.25

So, we have to return a combination of coins equaled to the input number

E.g.
coinCombo(6) --> [1, 1, 0, 0]
